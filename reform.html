<h1>Education Reform</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>1) Later School Start Time</h2>
<p>I would like to have an exploratory committee to gather information from the parents, students, teachers and administrators of the Jericho School District to learn first hand of the benefits and negatives associated with the late start time for Jericho High School. We should learn if there are added expenses directly related to this time change. Is there a real benefit to the students regarding their ability to learn? Does the average Jericho High school student get more sleep time? What is the impact on elementary students?</p>

<h2>2) Foreign Language</h2>
<p>I would like to have an exploratory committee to gather information from the parents, students, teachers and administrators of the Jericho School District to learn first hand of the benefits and negatives associated with the late start time for Jericho High School. We should learn if there are added expenses directly related to this time change. Is there a real benefit to the students regarding their ability to learn? Does the average Jericho High school student get more sleep time? What is the impact on elementary students? This is not a new and radical idea. This is part of the basic education offered in some European countries and widely used by countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea and well as in the Middle East. This multiple language education has been implemented successfully for the past 100 years if not longer in that part of the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>3) Writing Computer Code</h2>
<p>The other language that EVERY student should be learning is that of computers. Learning to write basic computer code will become as fundamental as algebra is today. We need to begin teaching these computer skills now, so our students will be at least proficient enough to create and maintain their own web page and write basic programs for their computers. The speed with which our technology is growing will make every person without these skills seem illiterate in the world of computers 15 years from now. Only a small portion of our students are currently leaving our high school with these skills.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>4) Alumni Focus Groups</h2>
<p>I also believe we should have focus groups comprised of Syosset HS alumni. We should learn what benefits they had from their high school education in comparison to that of their peers while in college. Perhaps we can adjust the elective classes to help our students if there were areas that they were weak in compared to their peers in college. Let's not just stay with the old because we are comfortable with it. The future is forever changing. We need to be open to new ideas and to be willing to allow change if it offers a better educational experience.</p>
