<h1>Biography</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Joshua Lafazan became one of the youngest elected officials in the history of New York State when at 18 years of age he was elected to the Syosset School Board of Education, receiving 82% of the vote in May of 2012. At the time of the election, Joshua was Senior Class President, graduating from Syosset High School in June of 2012. He is currently a freshman in the Honors Program at Nassau Community College. In high school Joshua was a National and World Language Honor Society inductee, and a nationally ranked Congressional Debater, receiving several prestigious awards from national tournaments.</p>
<p>After graduating from NCC, Joshua hopes to transfer to Columbia University. Joshua is the Founder and C.E.O. of Safe Ride Syosset, Inc., a community outreach program dedicated to ensuring that no Syosset teenager gets behind the wheel of a car while intoxicated, or is the passenger in a car with a drunk driver. Joshua and his volunteers safely drove home over 350 students last year, and he is currently working to bring his Safe Ride program to many high schools across Long Island.</p>
<p>Joshua has worked in both the private and public sector since his sophomore year in high school. He interned at Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, worked for the Nassau County Executive's Office and most recently for the Office of the United States Surgeon General. Joshua is a Nassau County certified basketball official and a Red Cross certified life guard in addition to coaching and refereeing in the Syosset Basketball League. Josh volunteers several weeks each summer at Sunrise Day Camp, the only day camp in the United States dedicated exclusively for children with cancer and their siblings. In 2012 Lafazan was named to the Long Island Press's Power List of the 50 Most Influential People on Long Island, and was named by Red Alert Politics as one of their 30 Under 30 in their national list. Upon completing his term on the School Board, Josh next intends to seek higher office in the New York State Assembly.</p>
